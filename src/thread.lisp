;;;; clevelib.thread.lisp
;;;;
;;;; This module provides utilities and functions for working with threads
;;;; in the event system. It manages thread creation, synchronization, and
;;;; cleanup. It also implements mutexes and condition variables for
;;;; thread-safe access to shared resources and efficient signaling between
;;;; threads.
