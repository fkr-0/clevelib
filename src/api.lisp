;; Event to Message Translation
;; special characteristic of an ems is that at some point the gap between
;; events and messages needs to be bridged. this is the responsibility of
;; a translation mechanism abstracted in the requirement of a generic
;; translate-event-to-message method. core idea here is as in general, that we
;; do not want to rely on any assumptions, what an concrete event or message is
;; in the users implementation
(defgeneric translate-event-to-message (event-message-system event &rest args)

;; Messaging - Messenger, Message-System
;; a messenger is anyone that you can pass a message to. its a bit tricky
;; because at this point we can argue that an ems and a participating client are
;; somehow equal in the sense that they both provide handlers that allows anyone to
;; pass them a message.
(defgeneric on-message (messenger message &rest args)

;; Message Handling and Relaying
;; but for now it seems as if this is simply ok. because while you can give an
;; ems a message much the same as a messenger, it is special in that it enforces
;; some relay mechanism. so we can say that an ems is a messenger, but a messenger
;; is not necessarily an ems.
;; it is an pretty much arbitrary decision to centralize relay responsibility on
;; message-systems
(defgeneric relay-message (message-system message &rest args)

;; Summary: in the simplest case we only require: give us some means of
;; retrieving the list of messengers, we will give them messsages. since
;; we have no means of directing messages to specific messengers, we
;; simply broadcast the message to all connected messengers.


;; Targeting Messages
;;
;;our implementation so far basically allows us to
;; broadcast messages to all connected messengers. but in many cases we want to
;; target messages to specific messengers. this is the responsibility as such
;; the minimal requirement for the "optional feature" of targeted messaging
;; is trivally: a method on messages that returns target(s)
(defgeneric target-messengers (message &rest args)
  (:documentation "Return the target messengers of the message.")
  (:method ((message t) &rest args)
    (declare (ignorable args message))
    nil))  ;; Default implementation returns nil

;; here i am not totally certain that we do the most sensible
;; thing. but it seems necessary to demand this facility...
(defgeneric set-target-messengers (message new-target-messengers &rest args)
  (:documentation "Set the target messengers of the message."))
;; ... to at least provide the ever so comfy setf impl.
(defmethod (setf target-messengers) (new-target-messengers (message t))
  (set-target-messengers message new-target-messengers))

;; thanks to default impl of target-messengers, we default for untargetted,
;; any more refined facility will have to take care of declaring the intention
;; to broadcast itself by specializing
(defmethod broadcast-p ((message t) &rest args)
  (declare (ignorable args))
  (or
    (not (target-messengers message))
    (eq (target-messengers message) :broadcast)))


;; now that we got an api to make a message adressable,
;; we can imagine a more directed implemtation of a relay:
(defmethod relay-message (targeting-message-system  (targeting-message t) &rest args)
  (declare (ignorable args))
  (if (target-messengers targeting-message)
    (dolist (messenger (target-messengers targeting-message))
      (on-message messenger targeting-message)) ;; all targets given by the message are processed
    ;; no targets exist, by convention, we fall back to the default behavior of relaying the message to all messengers
    (dolist (messenger (connected-messengers targeting-message-system))
      (on-message messenger targeting-message)))
  (values nil))

;; summary: we provide the complex mechanism of message targeting, by only
;; requiring the user to give us some notion of retrieving and setting a messages target.
;; still quite obvious but hey.



;; Propagation Mechanisms - capture, bubble, inhibit probagation
;;
;; The concepts above are quite specialized mechanisms to simplify message/event
;; direction in uis by operating on the assumption that receivers are nested in a DAG
;; therefore we require basic operations that allow us to navigate the dag:

;; we used the now well known concept of tiered or cascaded abstraction (my term,
;; do not know the approp one)
;; give us the absolute minimum for the required features (get-parent)
;; and we derive some generic solution for this.
;; if you have more specific requirements, implement the generic solution instead

;; since all those capture bubble mechanisms are simply options that you tick
;; for your message(ing system), we can not avoid to demand their definition
;; here.

;; helpers:
;; should we query propagation-stopped-p or force an implemetation
;; of stop-propagation?

;; discuss: should we have a separate method for each state? is without any
;; bells and whistles introducing the state parameter a good idea? in general,
;; we have to acknowledge the fact that we can approach this processing in two
;; fundamental different ways. either we let our pms call all the
;; propagated+at-target handling as some overlord, or we truly travel along with
;; the message from node to node with each deciding what their job is to do. my
;; intuition that the latter, while allowing to implicitly inhibit propagation
;; by simply not passing it along. however it sound plausible that we would somehow have to track
;; states of messages more closely to ensure each messenger knows its position in the path,
;; but this is hypothetical.
;; the first variant appears to be pretty straight forward. a malus is that  we can not just
;; let anyone stop a message propagation while handling. it needs to be signaled to the
