;;;; clevelib/debugging.lisp
;;;;
;;;; This file provides debugging facilities for the event system. It includes
;;;; functionality for logging events and errors, and tools for inspecting the
;;;; internal state of the event system. This will help developers to identify
;;;; potential issues and improve the robustness of the system.
;;;;
;;;; Features:
;;;; - Event and error logging
;;;; - Inspection of event queues, listeners, and handlers
;;;; - Inspection of event propagation and handling state
;;;; - Utility functions to aid in debugging and troubleshooting
