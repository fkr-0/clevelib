;;;; clevelib/prioritization.lisp
;;;;
;;;; This module is responsible for handling event prioritization in the event system.
;;;; It provides functions to prioritize events based on their importance, ensuring that
;;;; high-priority events are processed before low-priority ones.
;;;; The module also provides mechanisms for user-defined priorities and priority queues.
