  "Define an event loop macro with the given name and @BODY operating on
  events EVENT-ARG dequeued from INPUT-QUEUE and enqueuing result values != NIL
  on OUTPUT-QUEUE.

  Allows specifying an event argument, optional run flag, input queue,
  output queue, wait flag, frames per second, and manager.
  The body is executed in the event loop thread. The event argument
  is passed to the body.

  Arguments:
  NAME: The name of the event loop.
  EVENT-ARG: The name of the event argument.
  optional keyword arguments:
  RUN: If true, the event loop is started immediately.
  INPUT-QUEUE: The input queue of the event loop. If not specified a
               new queue instance is created and attached. @BODY operates on
               EVENT-ARG dequeued from INPUT-QUEUE.
  OUTPUT-QUEUE: The output queue of the event loop. If not specified a
               new queue instance is created and attached. The last or 
               returned value of @BODY is enqueued to output-queue if it does not
               equal NIL.
  WAIT: If true, the event loop will wait for an event to be enqueued,
        otherwise it will return NIL if no event is available.
  FPS: The frames per second of the event loop.
  MGR: EVENT-SYSTEM that manages the event loop. Defining the mgr
       allows accessing the loop as member variable and defines helpers implemented
       as methods dispatching on the Event-System class and allow accessing the loop and
       thread through name-based methods.
  @BODY: The body of the event loop. It is executed in the event loop thread.
         The event argument is passed as EVENT-ARG to the body.

  The macro body specifies depending on NAME:
    Methods (all dispatching on MGR):
    - NAME-RUN: Run the event loop.
    - NAME-STOP: Stop the event loop by enqueuing an :QUIT event and
                 allowing @BODY to process it in its last iteration.
    - NAME-OUT-QUEUE: Return the output queue of the event loop.
    - NAME-IN-QUEUE: Return the input queue of the event loop.
    - NAME-LOOP: Return the event loop.
    - NAME-THREAD: Return the thread of the event loop.
    - NAME-STATE: Return the state of the event loop: One of keywords:
                  :init :running :error :stopped"
