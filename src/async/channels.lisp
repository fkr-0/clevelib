;; ======================================================================
;; Channels
;; ======================================================================
;; The implementation is based on go channels.

;; Channels are a synchronization primitive that allow one thread to
;; send a value to another thread.  A channel is a queue with a lock
;; and a condition variable.  The lock is used to protect the queue
;; from concurrent access.  The condition variable is used to signal
;; when the queue is empty.

;; Here is a comparison between channels and the priority queue implementation
;; in queue.lisp:

;; Purpose: Channels enable communication between goroutines. Queues allow
;; concurrent producers/consumers to safely add and remove items.

;; Implementation: Channels have send and receive operations built into Go. The
;; queue uses locks and condition variables for synchronization.

;; Blocking: Both channels and the queue implementation support blocking and
;; non-blocking variants of send/receive and enqueue/dequeue.

;; Prioritization: The queue supports prioritized items using separate queues.
;; Channels typically treat all messages equally.

;; Buffering: Channels have configurable buffering capacity. The queue size is
;; unbounded.

;; Closing: Channels can be closed to indicate no more sends. The queue has no
;; equivalent.

;; Select: Go's select statement allows selecting over multiple channels. The
;; queue does not offer an equivalent.

;; ;; ======================================================================
;; ;; Select
;; ;; ======================================================================
;; ;;
;; ;; The select statement lets a goroutine wait on multiple communication
;; ;; operations. E.g.:
;; ;;
;; ;; (select
;; ;;  (send channel1 value1)
;; ;;  (send channel2 value2)
;; ;;  (receive channel3)
;; ;;  (receive channel4))
;; ;;  (default (print "no communication"))
;; ;;  )
;; ;;
;; ;; The select statement blocks until one of the operations can proceed.
;; ;; If multiple operations can proceed, one is chosen at random.
;; ;; If none of the operations can proceed and a default clause is present,
;; ;; the default clause is executed.
;; ;;
;; ;; In Go, the select statement is typically used to implement timeouts
;; ;; and non-blocking communication.  The select statement is also used
;; ;; to implement the default case of a switch statement.
;; ;;
;; ;; Timeout Example:
;; ;; (select
;; ;; (send channel value) ;; Either send the value or block
;; ;; (default (print "timeout")) ;; If the send blocks, print timeout
;; ;; )
;; ;;
;; ;; Non-blocking Example:
;; ;; (select
;; ;; (send channel value) ;; Either send the value or block
;; ;; (default (print "channel full")) ;; If the send blocks, print timeout
;; ;; )
;; ;;
;; ;; The select statement is implemented using a priority queue of
;; ;; operations.  The priority queue is ordered by the time the operation
;; ;; was added to the queue.  The select statement adds operations to the
;; ;; queue and then blocks until an operation can proceed.  When an
;; ;; operation can proceed, it is removed from the queue and executed.
;; ;; If the operation is a send or receive, the value is returned.
;; ;;
;; ;;
;; ;; The select statement blocks until one of the operations can proceed.

;; ======================================================================
;; Channels
;; ======================================================================
;;
;; Channels are the pipes that connect concurrent goroutines. You can
;; send values into channels from one goroutine and receive those values
;; into another goroutine.
;;
;; Channels are first-class values, just like strings or integers.
;; Channels can be passed around like any other value.
;; A channel has a type, the type of the values that can be sent and
;; received on the channel.  The zero value of a channel is nil.
;; The nil channel is not usable.
;; The make function allocates and initializes channels.
;; unbuffered and communication succeeds only when both a sender and
;; receiver are ready.
;;
;; Channels support two operations, send and receive.
;; The send operation sends a value into the channel.
;; The receive operation receives a value from the channel.
;; The <- operator specifies the channel direction, send or receive.
;; If no direction is given, the channel is bidirectional.
;; A send statement sends a value on a channel.
;; A receive expression receives a value from a channel.
;; The arrow can be interpreted as the data flow direction.
;;
;; ch <- v  // Send v to channel ch.
;; v := <-ch // Receive from ch, and
;;           // assign value to v.
;;
;;
;; make(chan t) - unbuffered channel
;; make(chan t, n) - buffered channel
;; The capacity, in number of elements, sets the size of the buffer in
;; the channel.  If the capacity is zero or absent, the channel is unbuffered
;; and communication succeeds only when both a sender and receiver are ready.
;; Otherwise, the channel is buffered and communication succeeds without
;; blocking if the buffer is not full (sends) or not empty (receives).
;;
;; A channel may be closed with the close function.
;; The multi-valued receive operation returns a received value and a
;; boolean indicating whether the channel is closed.
;; The close function may be applied to a channel variable v to close it.
;; The multi-valued receive operation returns a received value and a
;;
;; v, ok := <-ch
;; If ok is false, the channel is closed and all values in the channel
;; have already been received.
;;
;; We will try to emulate the behavior of Go channels as closely as possible including
;; the arrow notation through the use of macros.
;;
;; The channel class is a wrapper around a queue.  The queue is used to
;; store the values sent to the channel.  The queue is a first-in-first-out
;; queue.  The queue is implemented using a linked list.
;;
;; The channel class also contains a lock and a condition variable.
;; The lock is used to protect the queue.  The condition variable is
;; used to signal when a value is available in the queue.
;;
;; An example of the resulting DSL using the arrow notation with macros '->' and '<-':
;; (let ((channel (make-channel)))
;;  (go (loop (let ((value (<- channel)))
;;            (print value))))
